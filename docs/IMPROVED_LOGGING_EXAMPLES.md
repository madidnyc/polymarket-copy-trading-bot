## BUY Strategy - Skip Example (Old vs New)

### ‚ùå Old Logging (Unclear)
```
‚Ñπ Executing BUY strategy...
‚Ñπ Position ratio: 0.073% (your $266.50 / trader's $363262.86)
‚Ñπ Order below $1 minimum, applying 3x multiplier: $0.0144 ‚Üí $0.0431
‚ö† Order size ($0.0431) still below minimum ($1) after multiplier - skipping trade
‚ö† Trader's $19.57 trade is too small relative to balance difference
```

**Problems:**
- Unclear why the trade was skipped
- No solution provided
- Missing key calculations

### ‚úÖ New Logging (Clear & Actionable)
```
‚Ñπ Executing BUY strategy...
‚Ñπ Balance comparison: You have $266.50 vs Trader's $363262.86 (1362.9x larger)
‚Ñπ Trader bought: $19.57
‚Ñπ Proportional calculation: $19.57 √ó 0.073% = $0.0144
‚Ñπ Applying 3x multiplier (trade < $1): $0.0144 ‚Üí $0.0431
‚ö† ‚ùå Cannot execute: Final order size $0.0431 still below $1 minimum
‚ö† üí° Solution: Need at least $45851.46 balance to copy this $19.57 trade
‚ö†    (Or trader needs to make larger trades, or reduce balance difference)
```

**Improvements:**

‚Ñπ Balance comparison: You have $1500.00 vs Trader's $3000.00 (2.0x larger)
‚Ñπ Trader bought: $100.00
‚Ñπ Proportional calculation: $100.00 √ó 33.333% = $33.33
‚Ñπ Order size: $33.33 (already above $1, no multiplier needed)
‚Ñπ Best ask: 150.5 @ $0.65

‚Ñπ Trader selling: 100.00 tokens (20.00% of their position)

‚Ñπ Applying 2x multiplier: 150.00 ‚Üí 300.00 tokens
‚Ñπ Best bid: 200.5 @ $0.68

‚Ñπ Applying 3x multiplier: 100.00 ‚Üí 300.00 tokens
‚ö† ‚ö†Ô∏è  Calculated sell 300.00 tokens > Your position 200.00 tokens
‚ö† Capping to maximum available: 200.00 tokens
